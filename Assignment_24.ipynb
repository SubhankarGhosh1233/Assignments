Using lambda function, you can define a function and call it immediately at the end of definition, this can not be done with def function."

    "To make the function recursive, it requires its own term to figure out the next term in the sequence. For example, if we want to find out the nth term in the sequence, we need to know the previous term and also the term before the previous term. Hence, we need to know the previous term to determine whether the sequence is recursive or not recursive. So we can say that, if the function requires the previous term to find the next term in the sequence, then the function is a recursive function. Most of the recursive functions will provide the beginning value of the sequence and the formula that helps to generate the next terms in the sequence."

Globals are generally forowned upon because they can make code harder to understand and use. Return statements are usually best, but changing mutables is fine, if expected. Function may also communicate with system devices such as file and sockets. "
